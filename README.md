## Accessing the GoodProtocol Interface

GoodDollar currently is not running its own frontend â€” making the system more decentralized and censorship-resistant.
Users thus have to use one of the frontends provided by our community, like this one for example:
https://cocky-dubinsky-430a6c.netlify.app/ 

## Development

### Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Run

```bash
yarn start
```

## Contributions
